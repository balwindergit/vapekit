We have created three common function

getUniqueCities
getStoreNamesFromCity
getBussinessDetailsById


These two function getUniqueCities,getStoreNamesFromCity used the cached mechanism for the query response.. And store the data in base64 encode format and response data in json format



And same like we have home page, details page too


We open the image like this

images/locations/?i=<?php echo $data['town'];?> at home page and it download by the script.. 





These things done so far
